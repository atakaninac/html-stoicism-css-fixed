    <h2>What Is Stoicism?</h2>

    <p>Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that 
    flourished in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.</p>

    <p>The Stoics believed that the practice of virtue is enough to achieve eudaimonia: a well-lived life.</p>

    <p>The Stoics identified the path to achieving it with a life spent practicing the four virtues in everyday life: wisdom, courage, temperance or moderation, and justice, and living in accordance with nature. It was founded in th
    e ancient Agora of Athens by Zeno of Citium around 300 BC.</p>

    <h2>What Is Roman Imperial Stoicism?</h2>

    <p>The Roman Stoicism or Late Stoicism is the final period of Stoic philosophy. 
    Seneca, Musonius Rufus, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius are the most important philosophers of this period.</p>

    <p>The famous philosophers of this era not only continued and applied past teachings but also created new ideas,
     interpretations, and teachings from their individual lives. The Stoic period that is most widely discussed and heard of in contemporary times is this era.</p>

    <h2>Why Stoicism?</h2>

    <p>In my opinion, the most important philosophy that modern individuals should acquaint themselves with is the Stoic philosophy of this era. The problems addressed by Stoic philosophy remain relevant for contemporary humans, and its solutions are equally applicable. I believe that the philosophy of this era,
     Stoicism, serves as a remedy for the inner problems, quest for meaning, moral conflicts, and the soul of the modern individual.</p>

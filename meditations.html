    <p>Meditations is a work written and internalized by Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, who is referred to with titles such as the "Stoic Emperor" and "Philosopher Emperor".</p>
    <p>He began writing this piece in the late 169s and early 170s during a campaign to the north, specifically against the Germanic and Marcomanni tribes along the Danube River. In this work, he externalized the thoughts that guided him and shaped his inner reflections.</p>

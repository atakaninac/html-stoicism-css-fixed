    <h1>Gaius Musonius Rufus</h1>

    <p>Today, we are accustomed to hearing the name of Gaius Musonius Rufus often referred to as the mentor of Epictetus. His approach within Roman Stoicism, which elevates practical philosophy, is quite evident in his thoughts consistent with his own life. In the remnants left by him, one can observe explicit advice on action and a pronounced interest in practical application.</p>

    <p>I did not give any book recommendations for Musonius Rufus, because in different languages the titles of the books are changing. You can find his teachings by making a little research on the internet.</p>
